fairground-star
===============

Firmware for an Arduino-based star-shaped fairground/circus-style LED light.

Requires FastLED v2.1 or greater. https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED

Developed on an Arduino Nano (ATMega328). Compatibility with other AVR chips not guaranteed.

The touch sensor mentioned in the code can be any switch that goes high when "on".
I used one of these: http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00HSECKZO
